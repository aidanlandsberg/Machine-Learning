      "The following assignment aims to allow the student to implement the theoretical concepts regarding $\\textit{dimensionality reduction}$ to realistic data sets. The techniques, namely principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), involve a pre-processing of the data in order to reduce the number of dimensions within the given data sets. The assignment at hand contains two individual sections: Firstly, the technique of PCA is to be impemented upon the $\\textit{iris}$ dataset - containing various instances of the iris data plant - as well as investigationg the $\\textit{eigenfaces}$ phenomenon. Secondly, the SVA techniques is required to be implemented in order to provide a standard signature verification model. For each of the forementioned sections, an investigation is to be undertaken to provide a better understanding regarding both the history as well as the theoretical basis required to implement the problem at hand. Each section will thus contain a set of brief theoretical predictions followed by the necessary practical results accompanied by the analysis thereof. Ultimately, sufficient conclusions are aimed to be obtianed to provide better explainations regarding the previously undertaken investigations.       "
